        <h2><a class="vertical-rl">The Not So True History of Pizza</h2></a>
          <p><a href="https://www.worldbeardchampionships.com/"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zkMLVsRXdIg/UPpA0D8ns4I/AAAAAAAACBk/xdDGDr8cjKs/s1600/Funny+Mustaches_1.jpg" alt="from a Blogspot place"></a><i><br>Alfonse Von Glorkenheim</br></i></p>
            <a class="floating"><p>Pizza was actually invented by a little known Romanian cook, Alfonse Von Glorkenheim. Alfonse realized the amazing alchemy of cheese, sauce, and crust - and knew he had to share his creation with the world. He got on a boat and sailed to America in 1882. After landing in New York, he brought his delightful creation to the people and it has never left. After selling his 2,000th pizza from his home oven in New York, he decided the people of Chicago needed this glorious creation. He got on his trusty steed and galloped off, bringing with him a deep dish.</a></p>
