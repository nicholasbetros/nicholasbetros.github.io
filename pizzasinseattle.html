              <strong>MOD PIZZA</strong>
            </h3>
          </a>
            <p>MOD is the original superfast pizza experience – a pioneering fast-casual concept that puts you in the driver’s seat. Artisan-style pizzas and salads are individually sized, made on demand, and ready in just minutes. Choose from over 30 toppings – the price stays the same no matter what you pick. At its heart, however, MOD is a platform for doing good. The idea? If we take care of our employees, they’ll take care of you, and our business will take care of itself. We call it Spreading MODness, and after opening stores across the U.S. and U.K., we think it’s working.</p>

          </h3>
        </a>
        <p>World-renowned pizzas with humble beginnings.Like most corporate success stories, Domino's started out small – with just one store in 1960. However, in 1978 the 200th Domino's store opened, and things really began to cook. By 1983 there were 1,000 Domino's stores and 5,000 in 1989. Today, there are over 13,200 stores – including more than 5,000 outside the United States. Sure, it took more than 50 years to get here, but the trip was well worth it. Feel free to take the journey yourself. Order a hot, Domino's Pizza for delivery to your door and make your family's dinner the best they have ever had.</p>
